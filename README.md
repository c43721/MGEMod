## Downloading
- Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/sapphonie/MGEMod/releases/latest), unzip it, and merge it into your `/tf/` folder.

### ***DO NOT*** download by cloning. You WILL NOT be able to use the plugin in this way.

## Known issues
~~A server segfault can be caused by [certain interactions between Sniper, Heavy, and Pyro](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=302264), if they are enabled. This is a bug with TF2, not MGEMod. A SourceMod extension fix for this is available [here](https://github.com/Kenzzer/JetPack_Fix).~~ This was fixed in a recent TF2 update.

## What happened to the old repo?
- The developer, [Alex](https://github.com/alvancamp), privated all of their GitHub repositories a while ago, including MGE and SOAP-DM. This necessitated a new repository, aka this one.

They have unprivated them, and you can find the original unmaintained version of MGE [here](https://github.com/alvancamp/MGEMod).
